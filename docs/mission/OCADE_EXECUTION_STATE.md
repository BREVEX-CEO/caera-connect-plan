# OCADE Execution State

Resume pointer for Auto Continue, context compaction and usage resets. `PLAN.md` remains the
implementation authority and `docs/MEMORY.md` remains the durable session handoff; this file records
only the exact current position inside `PLAN.md` so a resumed session does not restart a finished phase.

## Branch and baseline

- Working branch: `claude/plan-implementation-n3yjkn`
- Branch point: `origin/main` at `a7a99e3` (`docs: repair OCADE authority consistency`)
- Environment note: `npm ci` on this runner does not install `@rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu`
  (npm optional-dependency defect npm/cli#4828). Install it with
  `npm install --no-save @rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu@1.2.7` before `npm run build`.
  This is a runner defect, not a repository defect: the lockfile already pins the package.

## Phase 0 — Fresh baseline and evidence repair (COMPLETE)

Repairs made:

- `README.md` regained the truthful-boundary statements the documentation rewrite dropped
  (storage modes, desktop signing/notarization, mobile store gates). Two readiness suites assert them.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/Backend Schema.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`,
  `docs/README.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/TRD.md`, `docs/UI UX Brief.md` reformatted to Prettier.
- `release/checklists/OCADE_MISSION_EVIDENCE.{json,md}` regenerated against the current `PLAN.md`.

Gate result: `format:check`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` (515 files, 8258 passed), `test:isolation`
(shuffled), `build`, `routes:stable`, `build:stable`, `performance:budget`, `controls:check`,
`browser-safety:check`, `supabase:types-check`, `integration:check` and `mission:check` all pass.
The only ledger `MISSING` is `ADMIN-002` (billing/seat overview), which `PLAN.md` Phase 19 owns.

## Phase 1 — Architecture cleanup and one authority per subsystem (IN PROGRESS)

### Done

**Root entry routing.** `src/lib/entry/root-entry.ts` owns the three `/` rules from
`docs/APP_FLOW.md`; `src/lib/entry/entry.functions.ts` reads the landing-seen cookie during server
rendering. Proved in a real browser by `npm run audit:entry-routing`
(`scripts/e2e/entry-routing.mjs`): first visit lands, a returning signed-out visit reaches `/auth`,
a returning signed-in visit reaches `/ocade`. Measured while building it: TanStack Start does not
re-run `beforeLoad` on the client while hydrating a server-rendered document, so the session check
also runs in the landing component.

**Onboarding wizard removed.** `/onboarding` is now a redirect to `/ocade`; the profile gate is out
of `_authenticated/route.tsx` and the hop is out of `auth.callback.tsx`. `DEFAULT_NEXT` is `/ocade`,
`auth.verify.tsx` uses the shared `safeNext` instead of a second hand-rolled check, and the
`onboarding_completed` column is no longer read anywhere (the column itself is a Phase 3 schema
question). `WelcomeTour` and `OnboardingShell` are gone with it; the harness helper
`scripts/e2e/onboarding.mjs` was deleted and `sign-in-and-onboard.mjs` became `sign-in-state.mjs`.
Route QA control presses rose from 74/68 to 275/608 once the tour stopped covering the workspace.

**Chat route split.** `src/routes/_authenticated/ocade.index.tsx` went from 6,118 to ~4,500 lines.
Extracted, behaviour unchanged: `conversation-model.ts` (types, limits, mode list, pure helpers),
`IncognitoBanner.tsx`, `ShortcutsDialog.tsx`, `ChatContextualSidebar.tsx`, `ChatHomeSurface.tsx`,
`ConversationDialogs.tsx` and `ChatComposer.tsx`, all under `src/components/ocade/chat/`.

**One composer.** There were two: the shipped one inside the route, and a standalone `ChatComposer`
nothing rendered. The shipped one took the name; `ChatShell.tsx`, `ChatEmptyState.tsx`,
`ComposerMenu.tsx` and `DictateButton.tsx` were removed with the tests that asserted rules about
code no user could reach. What those genuinely owned was merged first: the drag helpers in
`composer-drop.ts` are now what the shipped composer uses, and the open-microphone ring survives a
reduced-motion preference. The composer's textarea gained a real accessible name.

### Remaining in this phase

1. `ChatSurface` is still ~3,500 lines inside the route. Splitting it means separating the send
   pipeline from the presentation, which is a deeper change than moving components.
2. Re-check for other duplicate authorities per subsystem (tasks, storage, projects) before Phase 2
   moves persistence.

### Deliberately not done

`ComposerMenu`'s single `+` trigger is a Phase 17 interface question, not a reason to keep an
unreachable component alive. The historical route stubs (`cania`, `ficia`, `madee`, `home`,
`ocade.system`, `ocade.work`, and now `onboarding`) are the redirects `docs/APP_FLOW.md` requires.

## Next action

Finish the `ChatSurface` split, then re-run `npm test`, `npm run audit:routes:prod` and
`npm run audit:entry-routing` before starting Phase 2.
